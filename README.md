# MY FREELANCING JOURNEY AS A TRANSLATOR
Due to certain circumstances, I left the banking world and started my journey as a freelancer in 2003. I decided to use my skills in translating accumulated over many years to bring in an income. I share a bit of my journey in this repository.

## THE TRANSLATOR'S LITTLE HANDBOOK ##
This is the book cover of a little handbook that I've created. The handbook contains a condensation of years of experience as a freelance translator. It's a quick guide to kickstart the freelancing journey with confidence. I share about pitfalls and ways to a smoother journey.

**MY LIFE AS A TRADITIONAL 9-TO-5 EMPLOYEE**
<br />Prior to becoming a freelancer, I worked in the banks. Fresh from the army, I applied for a job in a local bank and was happy to start as a bank clerk. It didn't pay well back then (i'm talking about the late 80s). However, I liked the job, especially my immediate supervisors. They were nice people and I learned a lot from them. 
<br /><br />Two years after, a door of opportunity opened and I got a position with Citibank. Back in those days, working with Citibank was a dream for many. I loved my three years there not just because of the pay but especially because of my relationship with my bosses and colleagues as well as the work culture. I could see a stark difference between a local bank and an offshore bank in the way things were run. As a young chap, I acquired a set of excellent attitudes from that place.
<br /><br />I was working from 9 to 5 on most days, 9 to 9 on some days but it didn't dread it because I was contented. Sorry to disappoint you if i you were expecting me to write how i hated my 9-to-5 job, the daily commutes, the stress, the low pay, the tons of bills to pay, etc. Mine wasn't the case.
 
**THEN CAME ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY**
<br />While I was happily working in Citibank, it seemed good to GOD to give me a new direction. I had the opportunity to leave my comnfortable life in Singapore behind to volunteer my time in a country I had no idea about. It was Chile. As crazy as it sounds to you. I signed up against the wishes of my parents. I was 27. I will not elaborate the process here but the rest is history. 
<br /><br />Obeying GOD back then is a decision I've never and will never regret making. It was there that i picked up the Spanish language, made life-long friends, and grew as an individual while learning to pour out my life into others.

**MY FIRST MISSION ENDED, ANOTHER ON THE HORIZON**
<br /><br />Four plus (close to five) years went by, I returned to Singapore, got married and started using the Spanish language to bring in the bread for my new home. I never went back to the banks since I lost touch with my previous bosses.
<br /><br />Shortly after that, GOD decided that it was time for me to go on another voluntary mission again, this time with my wife of three years. This time it was Guatemala, also in Latin America, another Spanish-speaking country.

**BACK IN SINGAPORE**
<br /><br />The one year in Guatemala went by very quickly. Upon my return, GOD opened a door for me to learn marketing and business development with two companies. My eyes were opened to the online world as a result. Online marketing was still new to many. I'm talking about the mid 2000s. 
<br /><br />

**BE MY OWN BOSS**
<br />A year or so after my return, GOD dropped me the idea of starting a business. Having been exposed to online marketing (it was still very simple and straightforward then), I made the decision to do it in my free time. Besides accepting translation projects from translation houses, I registered a company (without any capital or upfront risks) and tried getting clients with a website.

**A FULFILLING JOURNEY**
Long story short, the business started to pick up just in time for the arrival of my firstborn. I enjoyed working and learning at the same time. Apart from freelancing skills, I was learning how to be a father (and a good husband).

**FREELANCING CHALLENGES**
<br />Up to this point, freelancing probably sounds like a bed of roses to you. If it were so, I wouldn't be writing this "diary" here.
<br /><br />Freelancing is great because there's no time wasted in politicking, there're no bosses to please, no commutes, no unfair rules, etc. There're also lots of freedom and autonomy. The advantages of freelancing outweighs an employment especially where work-life balance, where family life, where personal growth is concerned. 
<br /><br />However, there are challenges along the way. Big ones and small ones, common ones and unique ones. Some of these challenges can throw freelancers out of the game especially if we're not prepared for them (lots of cases).
<br /><br />In my handbook, I talk about some of them and how to avoid or overcome them. 
<br /><br />One biggie, for example, is getting new clients. This is a common challenge for all freelancers, irrespective of the profession. But that's not the only biggie.

**OVERCOMING FREELANCING CHALLENGES**
<br />After almost twenty years as a freelance translator, through some hardknocks, I've learned some precious lessons and come up with uniue ways of dealing with the challenges.
<br /><br />After successfully setting up a system to get clients, I had to deal with non-paying or slow-paying clients, unreasonable deadlines and demands, etc. I had to deal with software glitches, system breakdowns, lost data, legal threats, etc. I also had to come up with a solution for keeping the accounts, file taxes, etc. Every step of the way, something was learned and I became a bit wiser. The journey has been rewarding and i've not looked back since.

**GETTING NEW CLIENTS**
<br />I mentioned that one of the big challenges is client acquisition. Almost every new freelancer I know face this. But, I finally found a way to never run out of clients. In fact, there's a way to turn on the flow of clients on demand. I spent a tremendous amount of time working on this because this was one challenge that determined if i could make enough bread for my family.

**CLEVER MIND HACKS FOR CLIENT ACQUISITION**
<br />Someone aptly said this: *If you can't be found, your phone won't ring.*
<br /><br />That's easy, you say, there are lots of ways to be found of course: place an advertisement in the newspaper, make sure you're on the good old Yellow Pages (you'd be surprised that there are still people looking for services in the phone books), give out namecards, pay GOOGLE to get your company on first page.
<br /><br />Sure. Sure. But does the freelancer have the budget to do this month after month after month?
<br /><br />If yes, problem solved. What if you don't?
