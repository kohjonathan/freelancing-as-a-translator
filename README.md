# MY FREELANCING JOURNEY AS A TRANSLATOR
Due to certain circumstances, I left the banking world and started my journey as a freelancer in 2003. I decided to use my skills in translating accumulated over many years to bring in an income. I share a bit of my journey in this repository.

## THE TRANSLATOR'S LITTLE HANDBOOK ##
This is the book cover of a little handbook that I've created. The handbook contains a condensation of years of experience as a freelance translator. It's a quick guide to kickstart the freelancing journey with confidence. I share about pitfalls and way to a smoother journey.

**MY LIFE AS A TRADITIONAL 9-TO-5 EMPLOYEE**
<br />Prior to becoming a freelancer, I worked in the banks. Fresh from the army, i applied for a job in a local bank and was happy to start as a bank clerk. It didn't pay well back then (i'm talking about the late 80s. However, I enjoyed the job, especially my immediate supervisors. They were nice people and i learned a lot from them. 
<br /><br />Two years after, a door of opportunity opened and I got a position with Citibank. Back in those days, working with Citibank was a dream for many.I loved my three years there not just because of the pay but especially because of my relationship with my bosses again and the work culture. I could see a stark difference betweena local bank and an offshore bank and as a young chap acquired a set of excellent attitudes from that place.
<br /><br />I was working from 9 to 5 on most days, 9 to 9 on some days but it didn't dread it because I was contented. Sorry to disappoint you if i you were expecting me to write how i hated my 9-to-5 job, the daily commutes, the stress, the low pay, the tons of bills to pay, etc. Mine wasn't the case.
 
**THEN CAME ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY**
<br />While I was happily working in Citibank, it seemed good to GOD to give me a new direction. I had the opportunity to leave my comnfortable life in Singapore behind to volunteer my time in a country I had no idea about. It was Chile. As crazy as it sounds to you. I signed up against the wishes of my parents. I was 27. I will not elaborate the process here but the rest is history. 
<br /><br />Obeying GOD back then is a decision I've never and will never regret making. It was there that i picked up the Spanish language, made life-long friends, and grew as an individual while learning to pour out my life.

**MY FIRST MISSION ENDED, ANOTHER ON THE HORIZON**
<br /><br />Four plus (close to five) years went by, and I returned to Singapore. I got married and started using the Spanish language to bring in the bread. I never went back to the banks since I lost touch with my previous bosses. 

<br /><br />Shortly after that, GOD decisded that it was time for me to go on another voluntary mission again, this time with my newly wedded wife of three years. This time it was Guatemala, also in Latin America, anothe Spanish-speaking country.

**BACK IN SINGAPORE**
<br /><br />The one year in Guatemala went by very quickly. Upon my return, GOD opened a door for me to learn marketing and business development with two companies. My eyes were opened to the online world as a result. Online marketing was still in its infancy. I'm talking about the early 2000s. 
<br /><br />

**BE MY OWN BOSS**
<br />A year or so after my return, GOD dropped me the idea of starting a business on my own. Having been exposed to online marketing (it was still very simple and straightforward then), I made the decision to do it in my free time. Besides accepting translation projects from translation houses, I registered a company (without any capital or upfront risks) and tried getting clients with a website.

**A FULFILLING JOURNEY**
Long story short, the business started to pick up just in time for the arrival of my firstborn. I enjoyed working and learning at the same time. Apart from freelancing skills, I was learning how to be a father (and a good husband).

**FREELANCING CHALLENGES**
<br />Up to this point, freelancing probably sounds like a bed of roses to you. If it were so, I wouldn't be writing this "diary" here.
<br /><br />Freelancing is great because there's no time wasted in politicking, there're no bosses to please, no commutes, no unfair rules, etc. There're also lots of freedom and autonomy. The advantages of freelancing outweighs an employment especially where work-life balance, where family life, where personal growth is concerned. 
<br /><br />However, there are challenges along the way. Big ones and small ones, common ones and unique ones. Some of these challenges can throw freelancers out of the game especially if we're not prepared for them(lots of cases).
<br /><br />In my handbook, I talk about some of them and how to avoid or overcome them. 
<br /><br />One biggie, for example, is getting new clients. This is a common challenge for all freelancers, irrespective of trade. But that's not the only biggie.

**OVERCOMING CHALLENGES**
<br />After almost twenty years as a freelance translator, I've learned some precious lessons and come up with uniue ways of dealing with the challenges.
People were actually beginning to understand us a lot better. We made lots of friends on the streets, got invited to have meals, to events, etc. We started to make some friends. The team of four Singaporeans stayed for one twelve months before the mission ended. I opted to stay beyond the agreed voluntary period because i heard GOD telling me to do so. I made even more friends and had more practice with the Spanish language. I spoke no English as hardly anyone spoke English where I was.

**I NEVER STOPPED SPEAKING SPANISH SINCE**
<br />After my mission, language continued to be a part of me. And, with time, i decided I wanted to pass on my skills to others.
I started developing the course I mentioned above. In the process of which I began developing mind hacks and techniques which could shortcut the learning from one year to eight weeks. While the language schools in Singapore continued to teach language the traditional way, I taught it unconventionally and was getting results. It turns out that there were better ways for us Singaporeans to learn Spanish, there really is.

**CLEVER MIND HACKS FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING**
<br />For clarification, I'm not throwing traditional methods out of the window. Not at all. As mentioned, traditional methods work very well, just slower. Memorisation, written practice, oral practice, conversations, they work 100 years ago, they still work today! They work for those who're willing to put in the time. Just grab a Spanish language textbook from a nearby bookstore and start learning.
<br /><br />The techniques and hacks i have developed in the course is built on top of traditional methods. The only difference is a shorter and faster way to master the language. 
<br /><br />I have tweaked the hacks and techniques over and over again. My coursebook went through various revisions as the methodology got fine-tuned. It was a course that was helping Singaporeans speak, read and write Spanish in 8 weeks!*
